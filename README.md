## Excitable Tissue
Vertex model and effective model for an excitable tissue, as detailed in "Excitable dynamics driven by mechanical feedback in epithelial tissues".

## Authors / Contributors
- Fernanda Pérez-Verdugo (Carnegie Mellon University)
- Samuel Banks (Yale University)
- Shiladitya Banerjee (Carnegie Mellon University)

## System Requirements
- Simulation code is run in Python 3
- Numerical analisis is run in Mathematica 12

## QUICKSTART GUIDE
- MainFile.py: Contains our codes and relevant information to run the simulation of a 2D ordered tissue subject to mechanical feedback. Simulation results are saved in the directories "length_tension" and "results".
- snapshots.py: This code generate tissue snapshots using the data from "length_tension" and "results". Snapshots are saved in the directory: "saved_snapshots".
- EffectiveModel.nb: Contains the numerical analisis of the effective model for an excitable tissue.
